    "# Guided Project - Wordle\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project you will write a command line version of the popular guessing game \"Wordle\" in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will walk you through the process of implementing Wordle. First, the rules and requirements of the final game are stated. To simplify the code, the original mechanics have been. Then, the guide will walk you through the implementation function-by-function, providing tests and examples along the way to explain the intended behaviour. At last, you will put the functions together in a simple program that runs Wordle. Potential areas for improvements are also suggested in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules of Wordle\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the following has been adapted from the [NYT Wordle Site](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, a secret word is chosen by the computer at random from a list of 5-letter words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player must then guess the secret word in at most 6 tries. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. The player hits `ENTER` to submit their guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each guess, colors are displayed over the letters of the guess to show how close the guess was to the secret word. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 possible colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Green: the letter is in the correct spot\n",
    "* Yellow: the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot\n",
    "* Black: the letter is not in the word at all\n",
    "\n",
    "The game ends after the player guesses the correct word or they have finished their 6th guess - whichever happens first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an actual Wordle game.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"wordle example.png\" alt=\"wordle example\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first guess, `L` was the only letter in the secret word but it was in the wrong place. In the second guess, `O` was the only letter _not_ in the secret word, but all the other letters were in the wrong place. In the third guess, all of the letters were in their correct places. The word `PLANT` was guessed correctly and the game is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements for this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of running in the browser, our version of Wordle will run right here in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify some of the logic, we will be a leniant with the letter coloring of guesses. In particular, we will allow letters to be colored yellow even if there is only one of that letter which has already been guessed in the correct place and colored green.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say the secret word is `SHOPS`. Then, the user guesses `BOOKS`. Strictly, speaking, the second `O` in books should be colored green since it is in the correct place, and the first `O` in books should be black since there is only one `O` that was already guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our game, however, we will allow the first `O` in books to be colored yellow. Ignoring this edge case simplifies the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let `b`, `y`, and `g` denote black, yellow and green respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SHOPS\n",
    "BOOKS\n",
    "\n",
    "bbgbg <-  strict wordle coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "bygbg <- lenient wordle coloring\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, if you are tenacious and you want to replicate the game's original ruleset exactly, then some suggestions will be provided at the end of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But Where do the Words Come From??\n",
    "\n",
    "We have copied the words exactly from the New York Time's website for this game. The list of secret words and valid guesses are precisely as they are in the original game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The words are included in two files with this tutorial, namely: `answers.txt` and `guesses.txt`. The answers file contains all possible secret words, and the guesses file contains all valid guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck, try searching for an answer on the internet. Here are some helpful resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)\n",
    "* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)\n",
    "* [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/genindex-all.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about optimizing your code as you write. Just focus on getting it to work at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take risks! If you are not sure how to do something, just write the code how your mind imagines it and see how it goes. Who knows - maybe it will work!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's agree on what pieces of code we need to play Wordle. We will bundle these pieces of code up in functions with informative names so that the final code is easy to read. We need the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* read the words (guesses and answers) from the `.txt` files into Python\n",
    "* select a random word from answers to be our secret word\n",
    "* get and validate guesses from the user\n",
    "* color the guess\n",
    "\n",

    "## Improving the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "For our version of Wordle, we were lenient with the guess coloring. If you want to improve the coloring logic, we provide some suggestions here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, note that the logic for black and green colored letters does not need to be changed. Correct letters will always be green, and letters that are not in the word will always be black. So, there is nothing to change about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty is in yellow letters. Here are some edge cases to think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is only one `a` in the secret word, but the user guesses a word with two`a`s, then one of the `a`s should be black, and the other `a` should be green or yellow depending on where it is. Focus on coloring any potentially green `a`s first, then worry about the other one.\n",
    "* What if the users makes a guess with three `b`s ... or somehow four `c`s? What if the user makes a guess with two `d`s and two`e`s? How do we generalise the logic to work for an arbitrary number of duplicated letters?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to process the letters of a guess out of order, or even multiple times. In fact, there is are many potential solutions to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck, you can try searching on [Github](https://github.com/) to learn from people's Wordle implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!\n"
